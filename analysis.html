  <!--Quality Analysis-->
  <h2>Data Quality Analysis</h2>

  <p>
    In accordance with Brazil’s Open Data Policy (Decree No. 8.777/2016) and the reuse principles described in the national open data platform 
    <a href="https://dados.gov.br/" target="_blank">dados.gov.br</a>, we conducted a comprehensive quality assessment of all datasets used in this study. 
    This evaluation ensures that our analysis of urbanization, deforestation, and flood-related disasters in Brazil is grounded in reliable and ethically reusable public data.
  </p>

  <p>The quality assessment was conducted using four key dimensions: Accuracy, Coherence, Completeness, and Timeliness.</p>

  <h3>1. Accuracy (Syntactic and Semantic)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>S2ID (D1):</strong> Data is self-reported by municipalities, which introduces variability in accuracy due to local reporting capabilities and technical standards.</li>
    <li><strong>INMET (D2):</strong> Rainfall data is collected from calibrated meteorological stations, ensuring a high degree of measurement reliability.</li>
    <li><strong>IBGE (D3):</strong> Official demographic statistics from the 2018 census; syntactically and semantically consistent.</li>
    <li><strong>MapBiomas Urban Expansion (D4):</strong> Derived from satellite imagery with validated classification processes. Urban land cover classes were extracted consistently.</li>
    <li><strong>MapBiomas Deforestation (D5):</strong> Follows the same rigorous image classification process as D4, with a strong accuracy track record across Brazilian biomes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Coherence</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Municipality names and state identifiers were standardized to ensure interoperability between datasets.</li>
    <li>Rainfall (INMET) and disaster records (S2ID) were temporally and spatially aligned and showed expected patterns in high-risk regions.</li>
    <li>Urban expansion and forest loss trends (MapBiomas) complemented each other and reflected known environmental transitions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Completeness</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>S2ID:</strong> Underreporting is a known issue in certain municipalities. The dataset required cleaning to handle encoding issues and numeric inconsistencies.</li>
    <li><strong>INMET:</strong> Complete for 2024, though metadata extraction for each weather station required manual merging.</li>
    <li><strong>IBGE:</strong> Fully complete for 2018. No updated census values are available at the municipal level for more recent years.</li>
    <li><strong>MapBiomas (D4 & D5):</strong> Complete and consistent at the national level, covering 1985–2022 with annual updates and no missing years.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Timeliness</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>S2ID:</strong> Includes records up to 2024. Reporting delays may limit visibility of recent disaster impacts.</li>
    <li><strong>INMET:</strong> Fully up-to-date with daily records through 2024.</li>
    <li><strong>IBGE:</strong> Timeliness is limited by the date of the last census (2018), affecting population-based indicators.</li>
    <li><strong>MapBiomas:</strong> Last available version is 2022 (Collection 9), with annual updates generally released mid-year.</li>
  </ul>

  <!--Ethical Analysis-->
  <div id="ethical-analysis">
    <h2>Ethical Analysis</h2>
  
    <h3>Data Ethics Approach</h3>
    <p>
      The ethical analysis of this project follows the principles of the 
      <a href="https://dataethics.eu/data-ethics-principles/" target="_blank">Data Ethics EU Guidelines</a> 
      and the 
      <a href="https://theodi.org/article/the-data-ethics-canvas-2021" target="_blank">Open Data Institute’s Ethics Canvas</a>. 
      Given the project’s focus on climate-related disasters (e.g., floods) and their impact on human populations and ecosystems, we ensured an ethical handling of public data from acquisition to interpretation.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Our datasets include information aggregated at both the <strong>municipality</strong> and <strong>state (UF)</strong> levels, 
      which required specific attention to <strong>regional equity</strong>, <strong>data granularity</strong>, and 
      <strong>avoiding misinterpretation of territorial vulnerabilities</strong>.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Data Ethics Principles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Human-Centric Design:</strong> 
        The analysis aims to understand how urbanization, forest loss, and climate dynamics contribute to disaster exposure—particularly among vulnerable communities. 
        The use of demographic indicators and disaster impact data seeks to inform equitable urban and environmental policies centered on human resilience.
      </li>
  
      <li><strong>Fairness and Equity:</strong> 
        Aggregated indicators were used to avoid identifying individuals or small groups. In comparing municipalities and states, 
        we were careful not to stigmatize certain regions with higher reported disasters or exposure. Instead, we emphasized structural and historical factors 
        (e.g., infrastructure, land use) to explain disparities.
      </li>
  
      <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> 
        The data sources—S2ID, INMET, MapBiomas, and IBGE—are publicly accessible and cited throughout the project. 
        All transformations, filtering methods, and indicators (e.g., urban growth, deforestation rate, precipitation volume) are documented in a reproducible workflow.
      </li>
  
      <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> 
        The project adheres to the 
        <a href="https://dados.gov.br/dados/conteudo/politica-de-dados-abertos" target="_blank">Brazilian Open Data Policy</a>, 
        and metadata were respected for each reused dataset. Data reuse policies were checked through the 
        <a href="https://dados.gov.br/dados/conteudo/saiba-como-publicar-um-reuso" target="_blank">Reuso de Dados</a> guidelines. 
        The team also ensured internal responsibility for every data-cleaning or aggregation operation.
      </li>
  
      <li><strong>Privacy and Respect for Affected Populations:</strong> 
        No microdata or personally identifiable information was used. When handling sensitive metrics 
        (e.g., number of people affected or displaced), we ensured these were aggregated at the municipal or state level. 
        Regional summaries are framed to inform risk reduction—not to judge the effectiveness of local responses.
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Ethical Concerns and Mitigation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Avoiding Sensationalism:</strong> 
        While 2024 saw historic flooding in southern Brazil, the project refrains from spotlighting dramatic figures without proper context. 
        Instead, it contextualizes flood patterns within national trends and regional vulnerabilities.
      </li>
  
      <li><strong>Geographical Sensitivity:</strong> 
        Because data are available at both <strong>municipal and state level</strong>, 
        we took care to ensure that analyses do not reinforce existing inequalities between wealthier and poorer regions. 
        Disparities in data reporting across states were acknowledged and mitigated with proportional indicators.
      </li>
  
      <li><strong>Responsibility in Interpretation:</strong> 
        Visualizations and analyses are explicitly marked as non-causal. 
        Correlation between urbanization and flood frequency, for example, is interpreted as a signal—not proof—of systemic risk.
      </li>
  
      <li><strong>Public Engagement and Literacy:</strong> 
        The project includes simplified graphs and charts to communicate findings to broader audiences, 
        particularly civil society, educators, and local administrators. Technical notebooks and a GitHub repository are 
        provided for specialists who wish to audit or extend the methodology.
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Final Note</h3>
    <p>
      The ethical safeguards adopted in this project reflect both 
      <strong>Brazilian public data governance standards</strong> and 
      <strong>international ethical frameworks</strong>. 
      By treating both <strong>individual and regional vulnerabilities</strong> with respect and care, 
      the project promotes the ethical reuse of public data to support resilience-building and informed policymaking.

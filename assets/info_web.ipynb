    "> ethical handling of public data from acquisition to interpretation.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Our datasets include information aggregated at both\n",
    "> the **municipality** and **state (UF)** levels, which required\n",

    "> and **avoiding misinterpretation of territorial vulnerabilities**.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Data Ethics Principles**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Human-Centric Design:** The analysis aims to understand how\n",
    "    > urbanization, forest loss, and climate dynamics contribute to\n",
    "    > disaster exposure—particularly among vulnerable communities. The\n",
    "    > use of demographic indicators and disaster impact data seeks to\n",
    "    > inform equitable urban and environmental policies centered on\n",
    "    > human resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Fairness and Equity:** Aggregated indicators were used to avoid\n",
    "    > identifying individuals or small groups. In comparing\n",
    "    > municipalities and states, we were careful not to stigmatize\n",
    "    > certain regions with higher reported disasters or exposure.\n",
    "    > Instead, we emphasized structural and historical factors (e.g.,\n",
    "    > infrastructure, land use) to explain disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Transparency:** The data sources—S2ID, INMET, MapBiomas, and\n",
    "    > IBGE—are publicly accessible and cited throughout the project. All\n",
    "    > transformations, filtering methods, and indicators (e.g., urban\n",
    "    > growth, deforestation rate, precipitation volume) are documented\n",
    "    > in a reproducible workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Accountability:** The project adheres to the [<u>Brazilian Open\n",
    "    > Data\n",
    "    > Policy</u>](https://dados.gov.br/dados/conteudo/politica-de-dados-abertos),\n",
    "    > and metadata were respected for each reused dataset. Data reuse\n",
    "    > policies were checked through the <u>Reuso de\n",
    "    > Dados</u> guidelines. The team also ensured internal\n",
    "    > responsibility for every data-cleaning or aggregation operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Privacy and Respect for Affected Populations:** No microdata or\n",
    "    > personally identifiable information was used. When handling\n",
    "    > sensitive metrics (e.g., number of people affected or displaced),\n",
    "    > we ensured these were aggregated at the municipal or state level.\n",
    "    > Regional summaries are framed to inform risk reduction—not to\n",
    "    > judge the effectiveness of local responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Ethical Concerns and Mitigation**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Avoiding Sensationalism:** While 2024 saw historic flooding in\n",
    "    > southern Brazil, the project refrains from spotlighting dramatic\n",
    "    > figures without proper context. Instead, it contextualizes flood\n",
    "    > patterns within national trends and regional vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Geographical Sensitivity:** Because data are available at\n",
    "    > both **municipal and state level**, we took care to ensure that\n",
    "    > analyses do not reinforce existing inequalities between wealthier\n",
    "    > and poorer regions. Disparities in data reporting across states\n",
    "    > were acknowledged and mitigated with proportional indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Responsibility in Interpretation:** Visualizations and analyses\n",
    "    > are explicitly marked as non-causal. Correlation between\n",
    "    > urbanization and flood frequency, for example, is interpreted as a\n",
    "    > signal—not proof—of systemic risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Public Engagement and Literacy:** The project includes simplified\n",
    "    > graphs and charts to communicate findings to broader audiences,\n",
    "    > particularly civil society, educators, and local administrators.\n",
